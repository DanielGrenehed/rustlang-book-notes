# Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules

## Packages and Crates
A package contains one or more crates. A binary crate contains a main.rs and a library crate contains a lib.rs

Modules are used to organize code in a crate in groups. Modules can have public and private members. Modules can contain other modules and definitions for structs, enums, constants, traits and functions.
