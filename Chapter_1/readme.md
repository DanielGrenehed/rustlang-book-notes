Creating a project with cargo:

    cargo new project_name

TOML - Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language

In rust packages of code are referred to as crates.

To build with cargo:

    cargo build

And to run a cargo built program:

    ./target/debug/project_name

To compile and run with cargo:

    cargo run

The Cargo.lock is a file generated by cargo to keep track of the exact versions of dependencies of the project.

You can use:

    cargo check

To validate that your code compiles, this does not produce an executable.

To build for release:

    cargo build --release

This compiles with optimizations.
